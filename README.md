# DARE/SHARE

This project is built as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development coures. The DARE/SHARE application is a social platform where users can dare the entire community, with everyone able to participate in creating, doing and reviewing the dares. The dares can vary and will be decided by the community, be it for fun and virality or to improve the world, it's up to the users!

# General introduction and instructions

## Project Approach

This application is built using an agile approach, the functionalities were broken down into Epics & User stories, the user stories were split into 5 epics, but turned to be 4, as one was scrapped completely, more on that later.

## Epics & Milestones

The application features were broken down into User stories and added together into epics.
Each isse is a user story, each milestone is an epic

[All Epics can be viewed here.](https://github.com/FRNBDN/challengeshare-frontend/milestones)
The following Epics were defined:

- Navigation & authentication - all stories related to account management and navigaton
- Challenges - All stories related to all pages in the challenge group, so challengefeedpage, challengepage etc.
- Profile Page - All stories related to displaying user profiles, and info.
- Submissions & Reviews - all stories related to creating, displaying submissions, having reviews as a part of this due to them only being displayed on submission pages.
- Landing Page - All stories related to the landing page, but it was scrapped since it was more like a layer of abstraction, than enticement.

## Project Planning

The project was planned out using User Stories in github Issues and Project Board.

# User stories

All the user stories are on in the issues,

[Grouped in Milestones](https://github.com/FRNBDN/challengeshare-frontend/milestones)

[Issues List](https://github.com/FRNBDN/challengeshare-frontend/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

[On the finished board](https://github.com/users/FRNBDN/projects/6/views/1)

The total number of issues created are: 38

The format of the issues are:

**Title**

As a **user** I can **action** so that I can **expected outcome**

# Design & wireframing

## Colourscheme

The plan with DARE/SHARE was initially to infuse lots of colors and be youthful, but it got stale and tacky very quickly. So I decided to go with very basic colors in black and white and gray scale, with very sparing use of colors. I didnt choose any specific grays or whites but rather naturally landed on them as I was styling.

The colors I used were named colors such as green, red and orange, they are for the status of the submissions, so pass, fail, pending. The red is also used delete hoves and clicks and the red and green used on the button for review submit depending on the vote, if it is a pass or fail.

## WireFrames

The wireframes for this project was made with Balsamiq, and I believe it had some effect in how I wanted to style my project, as it was a good inspiration for a youthful design!

The wireframes were used as a rough sketch of what the application was meant to do and look like. Some features are not present, added or redesigned between the creation of the wireframes and the submission of the project.

## Typography

- The Brand font which is used very liberally within the project is 'Gantari', sans-serif. Other than that the regular text font is open sans, a neutral one to go with the very bold brandfont.

## Icons

- All icons used on the website are from FontAwesome, even the 'logo' that the app has is from there!

## Imagery

- As mentioned, the idea was to go for a youthful and bold look so there is a lot of thick borders, bold font and strong design on the website, with the colors being black and white, it lends itself to the imagery aswell, with it making it look a bit like a cartoon.

# Data model

The data model used for this project is implemented in challengeshare-api.
Please refer to the ReadMe of the API for the data model.

# Testing

## Validators

### Lighthouse

Lighthouse Results give me near perfect score on seo and best practices, but accessibility and performance is lacking, especially on the heaviest pages with the images tanking the performance the most, like submissions. The submissions page tested is the feed, and it is loading in essentially all models, images and the review create form, definately the heaviest of them all.

Mobile Submissions

### W3C CSS Validation

The style.css code has been validated by the W3C CSS validator and passed without errors from bootstrap, and also a final one by me, which was fixed

## Manual Testing

### Manual Test Case - Dare CRUD

Creating dare:

<img src='src/assets/dcreatenew.png'>

After inputting the data and hitting create this is the result, meaning it works!

<img src='src/assets/dcreatecomplete.png'>

Now editing dare, by pressing the small edit button on the bottom right:

<img src='src/assets/deditview.png'>

And after saving, remember the delete button in the bottom right of the edit page:

<img src='src/assets/deditsuccess.png'>

The edit is successful, chaning the title, text and updating/deleting and adding new criteria , now for the dares page after the delete being pressed in the edit page.

<img src='src/assets/dafterdelete.png'>

Successful test of CRUD functionality on the dare model.

### Manual Test Case - Submission CRUD

Creating Submission: After inputting the data and hitting create this is the result, meaning it works!

<img src='src/assets/screate.png'>

SubmissionPage view after crating the submission

<img src='src/assets/sedit.png'>

Edit page, same as create page but has a delete button, essentially.

<img src='src/assets/seditpage.png'>

Edit successful, text changed , image delete and upload

<img src='src/assets/seditsuccess.png'>

View of DarePage after deleting the submisison

<img src='src/assets/safterdelit.png'>

Successful test of CRUD functionality on the submission model.

### Manual Test Case - Review CRUD

Filling in the review form but not having checked all checkboxes...

<img src='src/assets/review.png'>

... Filled in all check boxes

<img src='src/assets/reviewgreen.png'>

Confirm creation of review

<img src='src/assets/reviewview.png'>

Editing review vote_pass and review text:

<img src='src/assets/reviewedit.png'>

Confirm changes to review

<img src='src/assets/reviewview2.png'>

Confirm delete after pressing x in top right

<img src='src/assets/rconfd.png'>

All CRUD functionality passed!

### Manual Test Case - Profile CRU(no D)

First of all the account has already been created, so thats the C out of the way,

lets move to viewing the profile before anything

<img src='src/assets/rconfd.png'>

## Automated testing

I did not manage to get automated testing to work, I kept running in to erros that the tutors wouldnt be able to solve either.

## Bugs found and solved

Throughout the project there were multiple small bugs found that were dealt with without any issue and the major ones that I couldnt fix are still unsolved!

### Unsolved bugs

#### Unable to sign out

I dont know how to solve this bug as the interceptors and the handle signout functions doesnt produce any errors, and there seems to be no clues as to why this isnt working, I checked the differences of the backend and frontend for the auth code and I cannot for the life of me find the problem. it seems to be an issue with the combination of the front and back end because the backend can handle signouts just fine on its own in development, but when its prod and talking to frontend, it crashes, but Im not sure if it is the front or backend that is the issue.

#### Unable to run Automated Tests

Same as the above in that I have found nothing that is cause for concern in differences between my code and the walkthrough code but for some reason mine doesnt work.

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39830580/jest-test-fails-typeerror-window-matchmedia-is-not-a-function) post has an official workaround for the issue I have but it doesnt solve it for me, since I get more issues coming after, and they seem to have no answer. The code insitute tutors are not able to help me either.
